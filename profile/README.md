## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

For the frontend, we use Kotlin for android development using Jetpack Compose as the UI Framework. You can see the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/pudding-hack/Sightry-Mobile)

### **Backend**

For the backend, we use Golang for the server with postgres as the database. We use microservice architecture to improve performance and scalability. We also use Amazon Rekognition for image recognition. You can see the backend repository [here](https://github.com/pudding-hack/backend)
